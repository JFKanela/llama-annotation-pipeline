# llama-annotation-pipeline

Reproducible Snakemake workflow for homology-based and *ab initio* annotation
of the *Lama glama* genome.

This repository contains the workflow, environment definitions and helper
scripts used to annotate the protein-coding gene complement of a *Lama glama*
(llama) genome assembly and to benchmark the resulting proteomes. **No sequence
or annotation data are tracked in this repository** — all `.fasta`, `.gff3`,
`.faa`, BUSCO downloads and pipeline outputs are produced locally and are
excluded via `.gitignore`.

## Overview

The project compares **four** protein-coding annotation strategies on the same
*Lama glama* target assembly, benchmarked against the *Vicugna pacos* reference
proteome (ceiling) and a previous llama proteome (baseline):

- **Liftoff** (`envs/liftoff.yaml`) — homology, DNA-to-DNA lift-over of the
  reference annotation, with optional `-polish` and `-copies`.
- **miniprot** (`envs/miniprot.yaml`) — homology, protein-to-genome alignment of
  the reference proteome.
- **LiftOn** — hybrid homology, reconciling the Liftoff and miniprot models.
- **Helixer** — *ab initio* deep-learning gene prediction.

### Automation boundary (important)

The Snakemake workflow automates the data acquisition, the **Liftoff** and
**miniprot** branches, and their BUSCO / AGAT / gffcompare QC. **LiftOn** and
**Helixer** were added later and are run **manually** (LiftOn) or on **external
GPU infrastructure** (Helixer); they are *not* wired into the `Snakefile`. The
exact commands to reproduce them are documented in
[`REPRODUCIBILITY.md`](REPRODUCIBILITY.md). The comparative report
(`scripts/build_report.py`) discovers whichever branches are present under
`results/busco/`, so all four appear in the final table regardless of how they
were produced.

### Reference asymmetry between homology branches (important)

The three homology branches did not start from the same reference annotation.
The difference is one of isoform depth, not of gene repertoire.

With `keep_longest_isoform: true` (the setting used here), the workflow reduces
the *Vicugna pacos* reference annotation to one transcript per gene with AGAT,
and it is that reduced annotation (`annotation_primary.gff3`) and the
corresponding reduced proteome (`protein_primary.faa`) that feed the **Liftoff**
and **miniprot** branches.

**LiftOn**, by contrast, requires the native NCBI GFF3 (`annotation_ncbi.gff`,
option `-ad RefSeq`), because an AGAT-processed annotation yields an invalid
proteome (see `REPRODUCIBILITY.md`). LiftOn therefore built its reference
dictionary from the full multi-isoform annotation. It consumed the Liftoff and
miniprot outputs only as evidence (`-L`, `-M`).

| Reference used by | gene | mRNA | proteins |
|---|---|---|---|
| LiftOn (`annotation_ncbi.gff` / `protein.faa`) | 37,446 | 56,758 | 56,808 |
| Liftoff and miniprot (`annotation_primary.gff3` / `protein_primary.faa`) | 37,446 | 21,233 | 21,283 |

Both references contain the **same 37,446 gene models**. They differ in isoform
depth: 2.67 mRNA per protein-coding gene versus one. The AGAT reduction removed
no gene. (In both files the protein count exceeds the mRNA count by 50, because
32 `V_gene_segment` and 18 `C_gene_segment` features carry CDS without being
`mRNA`; both are retained by the reduction.)

Consequences for anyone reusing or extending this work:

- LiftOn had more isoforms per locus available than the other two homology
  branches. Any direct comparison of completeness between the three should say
  so. The effect is bounded but not zero: on the reference proteome itself the
  primary-isoform set already recovers 98.5 % of BUSCO groups, so additional
  isoforms can add at most about 1.5 points there. That bound applies to the
  reference, not to the transfer step, where additional isoforms also provide
  additional opportunities for a clean mapping.
- The reduction generated 28 new gene identifiers (`agat-gene-N`) for gene
  features that AGAT had to recreate. All 28 failed lookup against the native
  NCBI database during the LiftOn run, and no other gene identifier of that kind
  failed: 28 out of 37,446 gene models (0.075 %). The log records 31 failure
  events because one of those entries also appears as a duplicated copy
  (suffix `_1`), and because two further failures involve native identifiers and
  have a different, unrelated cause. The remaining AGAT-generated identifiers
  (29,430 five-prime UTR, 22,526 three-prime UTR, 3,505 pseudogene) are not
  queried against the reference database and caused no failure.
- To remove the asymmetry, run all three homology branches against the same
  reference annotation. This was not done for the results reported here.

A second, independent asymmetry affects the *ab initio* branch: **Helixer** was
run on scaffolds of at least 10 kb (3,640 scaffolds, 0.34 % of the total,
holding 1,915,763,599 bp or 81.46 % of the assembled sequence), whereas the
three homology branches were run on the complete assembly. Completeness figures
are therefore not directly comparable between Helixer and the homology branches.

### Genomes (configurable in `workflow/config/config.yaml`)

| Role      | Species          | Accession           |
|-----------|------------------|---------------------|
| Target    | *Lama glama*     | `GCA_028534125.1`   |
| Reference | *Vicugna pacos*  | `GCF_048564905.1`   |

## Quality control & reporting

- **BUSCO** in protein mode (default lineage `artiodactyla_odb12`) on every
  proteome, with an optional secondary lineage.
- **AGAT** structural statistics per annotation.
- **gffcompare** concordance between Branch A and Branch B.
- A comparative report (`results/report/comparison_report.md` +
  `comparison_table.tsv`).

## Requirements

- [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/) 9.23.1 (the version used to
  produce the results reported in the accompanying manuscript; later versions
  are likely to work but have not been tested)
- [conda](https://docs.conda.io/) / mamba — per-rule environments are resolved
  automatically with `--use-conda`
- Network access for the data-acquisition rules (NCBI `datasets`)

## Usage

```bash
# from the workflow/ directory
cd workflow

# dry run (plan only)
snakemake -n

# full run with conda environments
snakemake --use-conda --cores 8
```

Input genomes are downloaded automatically from NCBI using the accessions in
`config.yaml`; edit that file to point the workflow at different assemblies,
BUSCO lineages or parameters.

## Data availability

Raw and intermediate data (genomes, proteomes, annotations, BUSCO downloads,
reports) are **not** included in this repository by design. They are regenerated
by running the workflow, or are available from the sources cited in the
accompanying manuscript.

## Citation

If you use this workflow, please cite it via the metadata in
[`CITATION.cff`](CITATION.cff). A Zenodo DOI will be minted from a tagged
release once the repository is made public (see the manuscript for the
version-of-record DOI).
